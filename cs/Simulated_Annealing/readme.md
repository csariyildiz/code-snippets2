# Simulated Annealing Algorithm

## Taxonomy

Simulated Annealing is a global optimization algorithm that belongs to the field of Stochastic
Optimization and Metaheuristics. Simulated Annealing is an adaptation of the Metropolis-Hastings
Monte Carlo algorithm and is used in function optimization. Like the Genetic Algorithm, it provides a
basis for a large variety of extensions and specialization's of the general method not limited to
Parallel Simulated Annealing, Fast Simulated Annealing, and Adaptive Simulated Annealing.

## Inspiration

Simulated Annealing is inspired by the process of annealing in metallurgy. In this natural process a
material is heated and slowly cooled under controlled conditions to increase the size of the crystals
in the material and reduce their defects. This has the effect of improving the strength and durability
of the material. The heat increases the energy of the atoms allowing them to move freely, and the
slow cooling schedule allows a new low-energy configuration to be discovered and exploited.

## Metaphor

Each configuration of a solution in the search space represents a different internal energy of the
system. Heating the system results in a relaxation of the acceptance criteria of the samples taken
from the search space. As the system is cooled, the acceptance criteria of samples is narrowed to
focus on improving movements. Once the system has cooled, the configuration will represent a
sample at or close to a global optimum.

## Strategy

The information processing objective of the technique is to locate the minimum cost configuration in
the search space. The algorithms plan of action is to probabilistically re-sample the problem space
where the acceptance of new samples into the currently held sample is managed by a probabilistic
function that becomes more discerning of the cost of samples it accepts over the execution time of
the algorithm. This probabilistic decision is based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for
simulating samples from a thermodynamic system.

## Procedure

Algorithm (below) provides a pseudocode listing of the main Simulated Annealing algorithm for
minimizing a cost function.

## Heuristics

Simulated Annealing was designed for use with combinatorial optimization problems,
although it has been adapted for continuous function optimization problems.

* The convergence proof suggests that with a long enough cooling period, the system will
always converge to the global optimum. The downside of this theoretical finding is that the
number of samples taken for optimum convergence to occur on some problems may be
more than a complete enumeration of the search space.

* Performance improvements can be given with the selection of a candidate move generation
scheme (neighborhood) that is less likely to generate candidates of significantly higher cost.

* Restarting the cooling schedule using the best found solution so far can lead to an improved
outcome on some problems

* A common acceptance method is to always accept improving solutions and accept worst
solutions with a probability <img src="https://acsariyildiz.github.io/images/py7.png"/>
where  T is the current temperature, ùëí is the energy (or cost) of the current solution
and e' is the energy of a candidate solution being considered. 

* The size of the neighborhood considered in generating candidate solutions may also change
over time or be influenced by the temperature, starting initially broad and narrowing with
the execution of the algorithm.

* A problem specific heuristic method can be used to provide the starting point for the search. 

# Exercise

Implement a Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve a scheduling problem. 

* Table 1 and 2 describes a scheduling problem. 
* Each entry in Table 1 represents how long it takes for switching from one job to another job. 
* For example, the entry `[1,2] ([Job1, Job2]=12)` is the time for switching job 1 to job 2 in Table 1. 
* The entries in Table 2 is the time a machine completes the corresponding job. 
* For example, the entry `[2,3] ([Machine2, Job3]=5)` is the time machine 2 completes job 3.

The problem in here is to assign each of the 3 jobs to one of the machines in such a way that the total
time to complete all jobs is minimized. 

Implement a simulated annealing algorithm for this problem.
