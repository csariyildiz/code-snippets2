## STACK

Abstract data type with the following operations:

* Push(Key): adds key to collection
* Key Top(): returns most recently-added key
* Key Pop(): removes and returns most recently-added key
* Boolean Empty(): are there any elements?

Stacks can be implemented with either an array or a linked list.

Each stack operation is O(1): Push, Pop, Top, Empty.

Stacks are ocassionaly known as LIFO ( Last In First Out ) queues.

## QUEUE

Abstract data type with the following operations:

* Enqueue(Key): adds key to collection
* Key Dequeue(): removes and returns
* least recently-added key
* Boolean Empty(): are there any elements?

FIFO: First-In, First-Out

Queues  can  be  implemented  with  either a  linked  list  (with  tail  pointer)  or  an array.

Each queue operation is O(1): Enqueue, Dequeue, Empty.

1. Implement stack data stuctures with all operations that defined above. 
    
    * Execute your program by inserting the records in Table 1.
    * Write a function that returns the number of elements in the stack.
    * Write a function that displays all the elements in the stack.


2. Implement queue data stuctures with all operations that defined above. 
  * Execute your program by inserting the records in Table 1.
  * Write a function that returns the number of elements in the queue.
  * Write a function that displays all the elements in the queue.
